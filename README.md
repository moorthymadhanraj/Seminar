# FRAMEWORK COMPARISON FOR DATA STREAMING & IMPLEMENTATION USING APACHE SPARK IN CLOUD

# Abstract
Basically, data are the units of information, which is to transfer, display, to the end users. Big Data deals with large-volume datasets, complex and growing data with multiple, independent sources. As per the increasing trend in data requirements for several purposes, the data is brought up in huge volume (Big Data). When it comes to handle/process more volume of data, the need of respective efficient tools, frameworks, cloud, databases are needed. This paper will discover about the elements of the popular big data processing frameworks.

# Keywords
Big Data, Simulated Data (Uber Data), Data Streaming, Apache Spark, Apache Storm, Apache Flink, Apache Hadoop & Cloud.

# Tools, Packages & Programming Languages:
AWS EC2 Instance, SCALA, Eclipse IDE, Windows Local Machine, Apache Spark

# Goal of the thesis 
The process of real-time data streaming is to handle and process huge volumes of data quickly. There is an increasing need for taking out information from functional data in real time, which is crucial in fast situations. The faster one can bind insights from data, the larger benefit in driving value, taking, reducing costs, and increasing efficiency.
